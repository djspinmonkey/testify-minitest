Testify-Minitest is a Testify Framework to run MiniTest tests.  Or put another
way, a MiniTest::Unit runner that runs as a Testify framework.
 
What I'm trying to say is, you can use it to get Testify to run MiniTest.  This
probably will mean more to you if you are familiar with
https://github.com/djspinmonkey/testify.
