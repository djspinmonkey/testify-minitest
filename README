Testify-Minitest is a Testify Framework to run MiniTest tests.  Or put another
way, a MiniTest::Unit runner that runs as a Testify framework.
 
What I'm trying to say is, you can use it to get Testify to work with MiniTest.
This probably will mean more to you if you are familiar with
https://github.com/djspinmonkey/testify.

Also, this project is currently at a very early state and likely to change or
be largely rewritten (the current freedom punching approach doesn't really work
and is super brittle).
